# My C++ Testground
Just C++ things, nothing else. This is a repo that I create to play with C++, while learning it.

**Note**: `requirements.txt` is to install Python depedencies for [Conan](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html), a C++ packages manager. Read the installation note in the docs for more information.
