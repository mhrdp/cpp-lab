What's the deal with that?\n","\n","## What is `namespace`?\n","`namespace` basically is a way in C++ to store a global variable, it has this syntax:\n","```\n","namespace <namespace_name> {\n","    <var_type> <var_name>;\n","}\n","```\n","You can use that syntax to create a global variables for your entire project.\n","\n","If we take a look at the top-most code, what it was saying is, \"use the `namespace` called `std`\", it basically like an `import` feature in Python. However, importing `std` namespace is generally not recommended especially for larger project.\n","\n","## The Best Practice\n","Among the reason why it is not recommended is because it could create a naming conflict, and when you import `std` all together, it is the same like you borrowing the entire shelf of books rather than just a book that you need.\n","\n","### But there are few things that you need to change\n","In order for you to get rid of `using namespace std` line, you instead need to specify `std` inside your code. If you take a look at what constitute the `std` namespace, you'll see that:\n","1. Variable type of `string` actually reside inside `std` namespace, so if you want to declare a string variable you'll need `std` namespace.\n","2. `cout` and `endl` also reside inside `std` namespace. You need both to let the program know you want it to output something and declaring the end of line respectively.\n","\n","So to counter that, you need to either:\n","1. import the individual variable that you want to use, e.g: `using std::string`\n","2. Append `std::` at the start of every variables that are inside `std` namespace, e.g: `std::cout << \"Hello World << std::endl`."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"hyLSppSk0rw9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629854795372,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":364,"user":{"displayName":"Mahardhika Dwi","photoUrl":"","userId":"18064939782869251856"}},"outputId":"90f8eb2b-407e-462a-9668-efc044d54ae0"},"source":["%%writefile namespace.cpp\n","#include <iostream>\n","\n","namespace sample {\n","    int age = 25;\n","    std::string name = \"Davicc\";\n","}\n","\n","int main(){\n","    std::cout << \"Fetch variable age:\" << sample::age << std::endl;\n","    std::cout << \"Fetch variable name:\" << sample::name << std::endl;\n","    return 0;\n","}"],"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Overwriting namespace.cpp\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"rdHUo6tz019f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629854798597,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":565,"user":{"displayName":"Mahardhika Dwi","photoUrl":"","userId":"18064939782869251856"}},"outputId":"090e7c7b-5369-4d6d-c1cf-01293b1a6afd"},"source":["%%shell\n","g++ namespace.cpp -o output1\n","./output1"],"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Fetch variable age:25\n","Fetch variable name:Davicc\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":[""]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"jXyTeQlD1Tnw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629856296034,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":363,"user":{"displayName":"Mahardhika Dwi","photoUrl":"","userId":"18064939782869251856"}},"outputId":"fa7d78e2-a291-48de-8145-ed980bd16c5a"},"source":["%%writefile namespace2.cpp\n","#include <iostream>\n","\n","using std::string;\n","using std::cout;\n","using std::endl;\n","\n","int main (){\n","    string name = \"Davicc\";\n","\n","    cout << \"Hey my name is \" << name << endl;\n","    return 0;\n","}"],"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Writing namespace2.cpp\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"xA1cCZVMARFM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629856300061,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":847,"user":{"displayName":"Mahardhika Dwi","photoUrl":"","userId":"18064939782869251856"}},"outputId":"94b2de94-1a41-48c7-de1e-24a31240118b"},"source":["%%shell\n","g++ namespace2.cpp -o output2\n","./output2"],"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Hey my name is Davicc\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":[""]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}]}]}
